# Cat_Dog-Classifier
Cat or Dog classifier using CNN

Training and Test set contains 4000 images of Cat and Dog each.

Run File Cat_Dog.py to train model and predict images.
New images to predict should be stored in single_prediction folder.

I have stored pre-trained model Cat_Dog_Classifier2.h5 and same is loaded for predicting new images.
